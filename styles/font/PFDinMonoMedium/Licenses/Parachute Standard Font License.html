<h1>Parachute Standard Font License</h1><p>This is a contract between you and Parachute Worldwide , a corporation established and operating according to the laws of Greece (“Parachute”). Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and upon payment of the license fee Parachute grants you a non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable right to use the Parachute font software (“font software”). This is not an agreement for sale of the font software or any portion or copy of it.</p>
<p>Font Software.  The font software you selected for purchase, is the property of Parachute and/or its suppliers. The term “font software” is referred to the computer program that contains digitally encoded scaleable outline font data and includes any related documentation, updates, permitted modifications and permitted copies of the font software licensed to you by Parachute. You agree that Parachute and/or its suppliers own all rights to the font software and its structure, selection, organization and code, including copyrights, patents, design and trademark rights. In addition, you agree that the code and structure of the font software constitute and contain valuable trade secrets owned by Parachute and/or its suppliers. </p>
<p>The font software is protected by International Copyrights Laws.</p>
<p>Standard User License. You may install the Font Software on up to 5 (five) “workstations” connected to no more than one (1) printer all located at a single geographic location. “Workstation” is referred to any device by which an individual is able to make use of the font software. You may not duplicate or copy the font software except as needed to use it as expressly permitted by this Agreement. However, you may make one (1) copy of the font software for backup purposes. All permitted copies you make must contain the exact copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices that appear on and/or in the font software. You may install the Font Software on a single local network only when the use of the font software is limited to the workstations which are part of this license.
